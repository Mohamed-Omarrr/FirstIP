<h1 style="font-size: 20px;"> This my first experience tampering, experimenting and learning code. This is currently my first project.
</h1>
<h1 style="font-size: 20px;"> I am currently in high school with the hope of finishing this year. I am interested in coding and i view this learning oppurtunity as a way to get my feet in the water in order to help me determine if coding really is for me.</h1>
<h1 id="text"> This being my first project i am unable to provide and background work i have done in the past</h1>
<h1 id="text"> My end goal for this journey is to be able to create a basic mobile application for a school project i havde that's due in september</h1>
<h1 id="text">I believe the picture on the right fairly represents me. My favourtite colour to begin with is black. I find black to be mysterious because it could have countless of things behind it and no one would evern know. It's simple and bold. It's simply a basic representation of me.</h1>
